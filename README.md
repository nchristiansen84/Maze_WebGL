# Maze_WebGL
WebGL Project April-2017: Computer Graphics

Added old project from April of 2017 from Computer Graphics course

I added Maze.html and Maze.js. I modified wallModel.js in order to add textures to the cubes, the other files were provided to us.

Projects had to be uploaded to a specific site, mine is at https://natechristiansen-3dmaze.netlify.com/

Note: Textures do not display properly in all browsers
